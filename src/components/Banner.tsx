            OpenAI Is Growing Fast and Burning Through Piles of Money
            </h2>
            <p>
            OpenAI monthly revenue hit US$300 million in August, up 1,700% since
            the beginning of 2023, and the company expects about $3.7 billion in
            annual sales this year, according to financial documents reviewed by
            The New York Times. 
            <br /> <br />
            OpenAI estimates that its revenue will balloon
            to copy1.6 billion next year. OpenAI revenue in August more than
            tripled from a year earlier, according to the documents, and about
            350 million people — up from around 100 million in March of this
            year — used its services each month as of June.
